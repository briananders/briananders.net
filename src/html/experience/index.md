      After graduating in May 2013, I drove out to California and began an internship at <a href="http://www.nest.com" title="Nest Labs" target="blank">Nest Labs</a>, a medium-sized startup in Palo Alto. I guess I made a good impression because they hired me. Since then, I have built a range of web based ...things. From support widgets, to product pages on <a href="https://nest.com" title="nest dot com" target="blank">nest.com</a>.

        Interning for <a href="http://www.smithweb.com/" title="Smith & Associates" target="blank">Smith &amp; Associates</a> over the summer of 2011 was very educational. Most of my summer in Houston was spent as QA for all of their internal documenting tools.

        Many are surprised that I have a long background of working around cranes. Though I am not a certified crane operator, I grew up running the crane in the family business, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Anders-Crane-Service/240049426876" title="Anders Crane Service" target="blank">Anders Crane Service</a>.
