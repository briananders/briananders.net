    <p>2013 - Present</p>
    <p>
      After graduating in May 2013, I drove out to California and began an internship at <a itemprop="url" href="https://nest.com" target="_blank">Nest Labs</a>, a medium-sized startup in Palo Alto. I guess I made a good impression because they hired me.
    <p>
    <p>
      Since then, I have worked on a wide variety of projects on the web team. From the <a href="https://nest.com/#works">Compatibility widget</a> that takes a user's home thermostat wiring information and discerns their system's compatibility with our learning thermostat, to the overall <a href="https://nest.com/support/">support website</a>. I have worked on the team long enough that there probably isn't a page that lacks my fingerprints (however small it may be).
    </p>
    <p>
      I really enjoy my work here at Nest, and I am always looking to tackle the next big task, to improve the user experience on <a href="https://nest.com">nest.com</a>.

      When in interned for <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.principal.com" target="_blank">Principal Financial Group</a> in the summer of 2012, I worked with a team of Java engineers to build a robust system to handle their secure documents delivery. Largely my work focused on building tests for their foundational transfer processes.

      Interning for <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.smithweb.com/" target="_blank">Smith &amp; Associates</a> over the summer of 2011 was very educational. Most of my summer in Houston was spent as QA for all of their internal documenting tools.
